Wardley Hall,30 Ash Dr,Worsley,Greater Manchester,M27 9RS,United Kingdom,haunted,The Screaming Skull of Wardley Hall,"Wardley Hall is home to the legendary screaming skull of Edward Brereley - a Catholic martyr from the 1600s. This cursed relic is considered one of Britain's best known 'cursed relic' hauntings. The skull is believed to remain permanently within the hall to prevent supernatural consequences. Late at night, loud screams echo through the medieval manor. Windows break spontaneously, and severe storms accompany any attempt to remove the skull. A ghostly monk has been spotted near the staircase, adding to the medieval haunting energy.","This 16th-century estate connects to Catholic recusancy during a period when Catholic worship was prohibited in England.
