- 3 points = 1-2 days
- 5 points = 2-3 days
- 8 points = 3-5 days (consider splitting)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** with team
2. **Refine Sprint 1** with detailed tasks
3. **Set up project management** (Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects)
4. **Begin Sprint 1** development
5. **Schedule regular demos** with stakeholders
