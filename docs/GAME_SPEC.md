### Database Schema

```python
# Models

class StoryTemplate(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)  # e.g., "Edgar Allan Poe"
    original_text = models.TextField()
    template_text = models.TextField()  # Text with [NOUN], [ADJECTIVE] placeholders
    difficulty = models.CharField(max_length=20)  # easy, medium, hard
    word_count = models.IntegerField()  # number of blanks
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class VocabularyWord(models.Model):
    word = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    part_of_speech = models.CharField(max_length=20)  # noun, verb, adjective, adverb
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # halloween, spooky, classic
    is_kid_friendly = models.BooleanField(default=True)

class CompletedMadLib(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    template = models.ForeignKey(StoryTemplate, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    completed_text = models.TextField()
    user_words = models.JSONField()  # Store the words used
    is_public = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    share_code = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)  # For sharing
```

### URL Routes

```python
# urls.py
path('games/', views.games_home, name='games_home'),
path('games/madlibs/', views.madlibs_list, name='madlibs_list'),
path('games/madlibs/<int:template_id>/', views.madlibs_play, name='madlibs_play'),
path('games/madlibs/<int:template_id>/submit/', views.madlibs_submit, name='madlibs_submit'),
path('games/madlibs/result/<str:share_code>/', views.madlibs_result, name='madlibs_result'),
path('api/random-word/<str:part_of_speech>/', views.api_random_word, name='api_random_word'),
```

### API Endpoints

```python
# GET /api/random-word/noun/
# Returns: {"word": "graveyard", "part_of_speech": "noun"}

# POST /games/madlibs/<id>/submit/
# Body: {"noun_1": "ghost", "adjective_1": "creepy", ...}
# Returns: {"share_code": "abc123", "completed_text": "..."}
```

### Frontend Requirements (Minimal)

- Simple form with labeled inputs
- One button per input: "Random Word" (triggers AJAX call)
- Result page with styled text display
- NO complex animations or image manipulation
- Basic Tailwind CSS styling (consistent with site)

### Sample Story Template

```
Original: "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary..."

Template: "Once upon a [ADJECTIVE] [NOUN], while I [VERB], [ADJECTIVE] and [ADJECTIVE]..."

User fills in:
- ADJECTIVE: spooky
- NOUN: night
- VERB: wandered
- ADJECTIVE: tired
- ADJECTIVE: scared

Result: "Once upon a spooky night, while I wandered, tired and scared..."
```

## üéÆ Game 2: Bobbing for Apples (Stretch Goal)

### Description

Simple keyboard/mouse game where player tries to "catch" floating apples by clicking or pressing a key before time runs out.

### Technical Notes

- **Minimal approach**: Use HTML/CSS for positioning, basic JavaScript for clicking
- Track score in session/database
- Leaderboard (optional)

### Implementation Priority

- **Phase 3** (after Mad Libs is complete)
- Can be built as standalone page with minimal Django integration

---

## üéÆ Game 3: Haunted House Builder (Stretch Goal)

### Description

Drag-and-drop or selection-based interface to build a custom haunted house. Choose rooms, decorations, and spooky elements.

### Technical Notes

- **Could use**: Simple form-based approach instead of drag-drop
- User selects from dropdowns: "Living Room", "Add Ghost", "Add Cobwebs"
- Generate a text description or simple visual representation
- Save configurations to database

### Implementation Priority

- **Phase 4** (low priority, complex frontend)

---

## üéÆ Game 4: Trick or Treat Showdown (Stretch Goal)

### Description

Two-player game where players take turns choosing which house to visit. Random chance determines if they get candy or a "trick" (spider, etc.). Player with most candy wins.

### Technical Notes

- Turn-based game state stored in session
- Simple button interface: "House 1", "House 2", "House 3"
- Random outcome generation in Django
- Could be async (Django Channels) or simple refresh-based

### Implementation Priority

- **Phase 5** (fun but complex game logic)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Required
- **Backend**: Django 5.2.7, Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (preferred by developer)
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS (already in use)
- **JavaScript**: Minimal - only for AJAX random word fetching

### Optional (Phase 2+)
- Google Sheets API (if vocabulary management by teachers is needed)
- Django Channels (for multiplayer games)

---

## üìä Success Metrics

1. **Educational Value**: Students understand parts of speech better
2. **Engagement**: Users complete at least 3 Mad Libs per session
3. **Teacher Adoption**: Teachers use in classroom settings
4. **Sharing**: Completed Mad Libs are shared on social media

### UI/UX Principles

## üöÄ Getting Started (for Implementation Team)

1. Read this spec thoroughly
2. Review database models
3. Create a new Django app: `python manage.py startapp games`
4. Start with Phase 1, Task 1: Database models
5. Populate vocabulary database using fixtures or admin
6. Build one story template to test
7. Create basic UI following ShriekedIn design patterns
8. Test with real users (teachers/students if possible)

---

## üí° Future Ideas (Not Committed)

- Achievement badges for completing Mad Libs
- Class competitions (leaderboard by classroom)
- AI-generated story templates (if AI policy changes)
- Multilingual support (Spanish, French vocabulary)
- Audio narration of completed stories
- Integration with Google Classroom

---

## üìû Questions for Developer?

- How many story templates should we launch with?
- Should vocabulary be kid-friendly only, or have filters?
- Do we need user authentication, or allow anonymous play?
- Should sharing be public by default or opt-in?
- Any specific Poe works you want to include?
