# Scary Mode Easter Egg - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Scary-Face Extrusion Easter Egg is a hidden, interactive 3D effect that transforms the user's face from their webcam into a terrifying extruded 3D mesh with dynamic lighting and animation.

**Status**: âœ… Implemented
**Branch**: `feature/scary-mode-easter-egg`

## Activation

### How to Activate
1. Type the secret key sequence: **S-C-A-R-Y** (case-insensitive)
2. The effect activates with a fullscreen overlay
3. Camera permission will be requested (first time only)

### How to Deactivate
- Press **Escape** key to exit and return to normal operation

## Shaders

### Vertex Shader
```glsl
uniform float extrusionDepth;
uniform float time;

varying float glowIntensity;

void main() {
    vec3 extrudedPosition = position + normal * extrusionDepth * 0.1 * (0.5 + 0.5 * sin(time * 5.0 + position.x * 10.0));

    glowIntensity = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(time * 10.0 + position.y * 20.0);

    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(extrudedPosition, 1.0);
}
```

### Fragment Shader
```glsl
uniform vec3 baseColor;
uniform vec3 emissiveColor;

varying float glowIntensity;

void main() {
    vec3 color = baseColor + emissiveColor * glowIntensity * 0.5;
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

- Webcam access
- getUserMedia API support

### Graceful Degradation
- Camera denial: Shows error message and exits
- No face detected: Mesh fades out after 3 seconds (future enhancement)
- WebGL unsupported: Error message displayed

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [x] Activation sequence works correctly
- [x] Camera permission requested once
- [x] Face detection tracks landmarks
- [x] Mesh extrudes in real time
- [x] Mouse rotation works smoothly
- [x] Scroll adjusts extrusion depth
- [x] R key resets extrusion
- [x] Escape key exits cleanly
- [x] Privacy notice displayed
- [x] Error messages appear for camera denial
- [x] Loading indicator shows during model load
- [x] Resources cleaned up on exit

### Browser Testing
- [x] Chrome (desktop)
- [x] Firefox (desktop)
- [x] Edge (desktop)
- [ ] Safari (desktop) - Not tested yet
- [ ] Mobile browsers - Not optimized yet

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Desktop Only**: Currently optimized for desktop browsers
2. **Single Face**: Only detects one face at a time
3. **Lighting Dependent**: Works best in well-lit environments
4. **No Recording**: Cannot save or share the effect (yet)
5. **High CPU Usage**: May cause lag on older machines

---

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Denied
**Problem**: User denies camera permission
**Solution**: Error message displayed with instructions. User must manually allow camera in browser settings.

### Model Fails to Load
**Problem**: TensorFlow.js model doesn't load
**Error**: "Failed to load face detection model"
**Solution**: Check internet connection, CDN availability, browser console for errors.

### No Face Detected
**Problem**: Face not appearing in mesh
**Solution**: Ensure face is clearly visible, well-lit, and centered in webcam view.

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Laggy or choppy animation
**Solution**: Close other tabs, ensure good lighting (reduces detection complexity), try on a more powerful device.

## Security & Privacy

### Client-Side Only Processing
âœ… All facial landmark detection happens in the browser
âœ… No video frames sent to any server
âœ… No facial data stored locally or remotely
âœ… Camera stream immediately stopped on exit

### Data Flow
```
Webcam â†’ Browser (TensorFlow.js) â†’ Three.js Rendering â†’ Screen
                                    â†“
                              (Nothing leaves device)
```

---

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Controls
- âœ… Activation via keyboard (S-C-A-R-Y)
- âœ… Deactivation via keyboard (Escape)
- âœ… Reset via keyboard (R)
- âœ… No mouse required for core functionality

### Visual Feedback
- âœ… Toast messages for state changes
- âœ… On-screen control instructions
- âœ… Privacy notice clearly visible

### Future Improvements
- [ ] ARIA live regions for screen readers
- [ ] Disable option for motion sensitivity
- [ ] High contrast mode option

---

## Deployment Notes

### Production Considerations
1. **CDN Dependencies**: Uses public CDNs for TensorFlow.js and Three.js
   - Consider self-hosting for reliability
   - Current CDNs: jsdelivr.net

2. **Static Files**: JavaScript file must be collected
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

3. **HTTPS Required**: getUserMedia API requires HTTPS in production

4. **Browser Requirements**: Add feature detection and fallback messaging
