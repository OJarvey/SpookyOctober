## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Hackathon pace: balance speed with code quality

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use Django best practices
- Keep views clean (business logic in models/services)

### Testing Strategy
- TBD based on hackathon timeline
- Minimum: manual testing of critical paths
- Optional: Unit tests for core functionality

### Development Phases
1. **Setup Phase**: Django installation, project structure, database configuration
2. **Core Development**: Implement main features
3. **Integration**: Connect all components
4. **Polish**: UI/UX refinement, bug fixes
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to Heroku
